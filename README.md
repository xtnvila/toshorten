# To Shorten

This is a simple URL shortener written in django, for every given URL a new ID
is created and stored in the database, then presented to the user in a friendly format.

~~This app is currently live in heroku: https://toshorten.herokuapp.com/~~

As you probably know, Heroku is no longer free so the deployment lifecycle of this app has sadly come to an  end.
